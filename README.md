# intro_CS
School projects

this repository contains my noteworthy school projects displaying my understanding of the fundamentals of Python. 

LMS project CS2250 WR.py is a library management simulation I wrote for the first project of my summer course CS 2250 - Programming and data structures
the LMS project was developed to showcase my understanding and capability with object oriented programming.

Project9_introCS-1.py is a simple algorithm we developed in class to begin developing our understanding of data manipulation methods. The binary search is designed for large data sets, the linear search showcases -
the fundamental concept of searching through small data sets.

introCS_guessing_game_WR.py is the final project from intro CS during my spring semester of 2025, I modified and enhanced the basic project as I came up with new ideas. 
The basic project was simply to guess from a static set of numbers, I decided it would be a better game if it gave hints after getting some questions wrong. I also liked the idea of random number generating -
as an option. Aditionally when you successfully identify the number it will print how many incorrect guesses the player made. 

chapter4_math.py is an early project from intro CS during my spring semester 2025. This displays a robust slope line formula. I tend to focus a lot of my programs on graphing and modeling methods.
