School projects

this repository contains my noteworthy school projects displaying my understanding of the fundamentals of Python. 

LMS project CS2250 WR.py is a library management simulation I wrote for the first project of my summer course CS 2250 - Programming and data structures
the LMS project was developed to showcase my understanding and capability with object oriented programming.

Project9_introCS-1.py is a simple algorithm we developed in class to begin developing our understanding of data manipulation methods. The binary search is designed for large data sets, the linear search showcases 
the fundamental concept of searching through small data sets.

introCS_guessing_game_WR.py is the final project from intro CS during my spring semester of 2025, I modified and enhanced the basic project as I came up with new ideas. 
The basic project was simply to guess from a static set of numbers, I decided it would be a better game if it gave hints after getting some questions wrong. I also liked the idea of random number generating 
as an option. Aditionally when you successfully identify the number it will print how many incorrect guesses the player made. 

chapter4_math.py is an early project from intro CS during my spring semester 2025. This displays a robust slope line formula. I tend to focus a lot of my programs on graphing and modeling methods.

tecan_plate_reader program is a simple quality of life code I wrote for work, there is further room for automation but given the destination file is a sharepoint exel document I kept this script bare bones so I don't overwrite something online. 

stoplight project is project 2 in CS2250 summer course at UMSL. I added an off button option but beyond that it's a simple interactive graphic. 

mismatch_fixer loads a text file, converts the strings into iterable format, iterates through characters. when it points to a "(", "{", or "[" symbol, the program begins looking for that symbols partner value. If a partner value exists but is from a different key, the mismatched partner is swapped with the intended value from the dictionary of symbols being iterated over.

DNA extraction yield graph is a code to show an example of taking tables from excel, converting to .csv, manipulating the data to ensure reliable output, and then plotting the data. This was for an experiment at work.
